                New game release set to be next week Monday
              </h5>
              <div className="text-left">
                The UK regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA),
                has published an addendum to its provisional findings on
                Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition and has now narrowed
                its scope of concerns. The CMA has received new evidence that
                has led it to conclude that if the acquisition is approved it
                won't significantly lessen competition in the video game console
                market in the UK. The new evidence shows that Microsoft would
                lose significant money if it were to make Call of Duty exclusive
                to Xbox consoles and this would incentivize Microsoft to
                continue to release Call of Duty games on PlayStation consoles.
                "We appreciate the CMAâ€™s rigorous and thorough evaluation of the
                evidence and welcome its updated provisional findings," said the
                corporate vice president and deputy general counsel for
                Microsoft Rima Alaily in a statement sent to The Verge. "This
                deal will provide more players with more choice in how they play
                Call of Duty and their favourite games. We look forward to
                working with the CMA to resolve any outstanding concerns."
